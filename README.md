VerCors Verification Toolset ![Travis (.org) branch](https://img.shields.io/travis/utwente-fmt/vercors/master?label=master) ![Travis (.org) branch](https://img.shields.io/travis/utwente-fmt/vercors/dev?label=dev)
=======

This repository hosts VerCors, a toolset for the verification of concurrent and parallel programs. VerCors aims to verify many different concurrency constructs, including: heterogeneous concurrency (Java and C), GPU kernels using barriers and atomics (OpenCL), and compiler directives as used in deterministic parallelism (OpenMP). VerCors is able to prove data-race freedom, memory safety, and functional correctness of (concurrent) programs written in Java, C, OpenCL, OpenMP, and PVL (Prototypal Verification Language, a procedural toy language for prototyping new verification features). Moreover, VerCors is designed to be language-independent, which makes adding new front-end languages a straightforward engineering effort.

A list of verified examples and case studies is maintained online and can be found [here](http://ctit-vm2.ewi.utwente.nl). This webpage also contains an online interface for VerCors and allows to try VerCors online.

The latest release of VerCors (as a collection of JARs) can be downloaded [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/ImxHX0lJyBRgd60).

Installation Instructions
-------------

The VerCors toolset can be installed and used on MacOS X, Linux, and Windows (via Cygwin). When using Windows make sure that the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` is configured. A basic installation requires:

- Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 (the current version of VerCors does _not_ work with Java 9!)
- Git (on Windows you need Git Bash, see <https://git-scm.com/downloads>)
- Apache Ant, version 1.10.3 (see <http://ant.apache.org> for instructions)
- Apache Commons (from <https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/>)
- Scala SBT, version 1.1.4 (see <http://www.scala-sbt.org> for instructions)
- clang (see <https://clang.llvm.org/>)

If you have these requirements, proceed to ['Building'](#building). On MacOS X, the easiest way to get them is:

0. Be sure to have installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
1. brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
2. brew cask install java8
3. brew install ant
4. Rest of the instructions [below](#building)


### Building

For a basic build of VerCors the following steps should be taken:

1. Clone the VerCors repository using `git clone https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors.git` and move into the cloned directory, `cd vercors`.
2. Create symbolic links to link the Viper modules, as described on the [vercors/viper page](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/tree/master/vercors/viper). Users with a Unix system can also use the travis_build.sh script to create the symbolic links and install VerCors by running 'sh travis_build.sh' from the project's root directory.
3. Build VerCors with Ant by running `ant clean`, followed by `ant`.
4. Test whether the build was successful by running `./unix/bin/vct --test=examples/manual --tool=silicon --lang=pvl,java`.

The last command tests the VerCors installation by verifying a large collection of examples (from the `./examples` directory). This command should eventually report that `all ? tests passed`.

Usage instructions
-------------

VerCors verifies programs that are annotated with JML-style specifications (the underlying theory uses separation logic with permission accounting). Details on the specification language can be found on the VerCors [Wiki pages](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki). Furthermore, a large collection of example programs can be found (and verified) in the `./examples` directory.

The VerCors toolset can be used from the main directory by running `./unix/bin/vct --silver=silicon <filepath>`, with `<filepath>` the path of the (Java, C, or PVL) file to verify.
